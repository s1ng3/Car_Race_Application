## Updated

Integrating Semaphore and CarRace so that the race begins when the semaphore turns green (i.e., when the Semaphore thread finishes execution).

Starting with this exercise, work within the raceapp package. Copy the classes from the racedemo package into the raceapp package and make any necessary modifications.

Modifying the application from Exercise 3 so that a sound starts playing when the cars begin racing and stops when all cars have finished. It incorporates a sample audio file that can be played.

Incorporating a mechanism to detect and display (in text or graphical mode) the standings after the race has concluded and the race duration for each car.

Developing a thread that increments a timer (long variable) every 10 milliseconds. The thread will start when the race begins and stop when the race ends.
